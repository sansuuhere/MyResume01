        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>As a pre-final year student pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Technology at UMIT, Mumbai, 
           I am a dynamic and inquisitive learner with a profound passion for technology. 
           My primary aim is to harness cutting-edge technologies and frameworks to devise pragmatic solutions 
           for real-world problems. <br/> With a dedicated commitment to web development, I thrive on coding, 
           bolstered by my affection for coffee and strong communication abilities. My interests extend into 
           the realms of machine learning and finance, compelling me to continuously explore diverse frameworks and tools.<br />
           My ultimate aspiration is to give back to the community by sharing the knowledge and 
           skills I acquire along this enriching journey.
